baseSimulation.txt contains the code for SLiM
createSimulationRuns.sh creates simGeneX.txt for each gene density X, based on the baseSimulation code
baseSimQsub.sh contains the basic code to run SLiM given the gene density
createSimQsubs.sh creates the instructions for the HPC simQsubGeneX.sh based on the baseSimQsub
This code also sets SLiM running for each gene density
seed.txt contains the seeds for the SLiM runs
convertToTped.sh converts the resulting vcf files to tped format
giveNames.sh gives each snp a name
Xcp is the base code for running LDMAP
createCPfiles makes cpX files for each gene density X based on Xcp
baseRunLDMAP.sh is the base LDMAP code for running LDMAP
createLDMAPQsubs.sh creates runLDMAPX.sh for each gene density X based on baseRunLDMAP, and runs LDMAP
the output of this is GXmap for each gene density X
createCSVfiles.xlsm converts GXmap to .csv format
simLDMAP.R does the analysis and graphs
